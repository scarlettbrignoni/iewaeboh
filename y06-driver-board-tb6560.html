User Guide for 4 axis TB6560 driver board Product Features: • Toshiba TB6560AHQ chip - High power, maximum 3.5A drive current chipset ! • 1-1/16 microstep setting - Higher accuracy and smoother operation than standard I bought a Chinese board on Amazon ( and wired up all my steppers, but I can't get them to move. I'm pretty frustrated with the board and lack of quality documentation, so I want to abandon it entirely and buy something else that's easier to work with. What is the best driver board for NEMA 17/23 steppers? I want something easy to work with, hopefully just plug-and-play The CNC TB6560 4 Axis Stepper Motor Driver Board comes with DB25 parallel cables and wire connectors. It is suitable for processing various pattern modules, carving portrait, scenery, handwriting and sealing. I am planning on building a CNC machine for at home, I've scoured instructables, youtube, etc. and have an idea about what sort of machine I'd like to build (relatively small, 3 axis, solid base, all movement in the gantry). My question though is this: I would like to use an arduino for the controller combined with a grbl compatible board. I see the gShield but note that there have been some reports of them burning up on the X portion without warning. What is the advice here for arduino compa. CNC stepper motor driver board TB6560,the new chip TB6560AHQ of TOSHIBA, the max ouput peak current can reach to 3.5A, this driver board can drive the 2-phase or 4-phase stepper motor whose current.  Ebay 3040 is in my garage, attached to a dedicated PC. It's a USB model, not parallel. Silly me thought that would be easier. I'm trying with demo versions of both Mach3 and CNC USB. I've installed whatever drivers I can find, but nothing seems to work to get this machine detected. The controller board says BMCE04U-Plus, BITSENSOR.COM. That site is down and my google-fu is failing me. I would really appreciate any guidance. I've reached out to the seller, but no response yet. Of course 
ARDUINO UNO + TB6560 Stepper Motor Driver: Hi. Good dayThis is my first instructable. Hopefully anybody can comment if you want to ask question or correct me if i am wrongOk, this is tutorial to drive stepper motor using ARDUINO and TB6560 Stepper motor driver. You acctually I'm trying to build a CNC router after finishing my 3d printer, but I'm not completely understanding the electronics. So far on my list is stepper motors for the 3 axis, 3 tb6560 drivers and an arduino to control it all (planning on using grbl firmware) Is this all i'd need to get it up and running? I used RAMPS 1.4 for my 3d printer, but am not sure if some kind of similar shield for the arduino would be needed. I read a bit about breakout boards, but I'm not completely sure why I shouldn't. Note: this board is neither reprappable nor open source, so it's a bit questionable whether it belongs into this Wiki. Bogdan stuffed it into the wiki since he's using one or two, and he suggests folk may want to check I'm building a CNC router and I'm wondering if you've had any success with this type of setup, or if I should trust it enough to blow 0 on it.

Tb6560 stepping motor driver  Author: Administrator Created Date: 8/21/2012 12:30:19. I have been facinated with CNC for a long time and am finally going to get myself a machine. Most likely the Shapeoko 2. What confuses me the most is the electronics part. I kind of understand the old school electronics but understand nothing about the arduino stuff. The Tinyg controller sounds pretty cool but I have no idea how to set this up or use it. I can't find anything on the internet. What all do I need to use this, hardware and software related? Do I just need the Tinyg and motors.
